This is the minimal release of Project MD. This is enough source code to
comply with the GPL, but it's practically impossible to edit the data (unless
you happen to have suitable tools separately or you like to do hex editing).
Will provide a full release of the data source files later.

Sadly, you need asm68k to build this, which is proprietary software :/ Other
assemblers won't work without lots of modifications to the source code (since
each assembler insists on having its own variant of the syntax), so for now
this will have to do. Whenever I get time to make a new assembler to replace
asm68k, I will do it so it can be built with 100% free software.

The build script is for *nix only, sorry, no Windows script :/ You can still
use it to tell what steps to take to build it, though.

By the way: the compressed files are actually in SLZ format. Project MD was
developed before SLZ existed, and in fact this is the earliest implementation
of it (as such, also expect decompression to be slower than in the 68000
source code provided in mdtools). If you need to replace the data of a
compressed blob, use SLZ.

The Echo sound engine is a blob in this release. You can get the source code
for the newest version from http://echo.mdscene.net/
