Official GitHub repo for Project MD. Here you will find the following stuff:

- /bin ....... Prebuilt binaries
- /minimal ... Minimal source release

TO-DO: full source release that contains the source files to the data, not
just the code. But that will take some time. The minimal release is still
enough to build the game.

Project MD uses the Echo sound engine: http://echo.mdscene.net/
